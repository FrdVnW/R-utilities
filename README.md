# Utility functions for R.

These R script stores all the utility function I've found useful in my R code developments and that are not specific to a single project

Either fork/clone the repo for your own use or simply copy/paste the functions you need from the [description file](./R-utilities.html)


## How to contribute ? 
You can add you own functions via pull request. Of course, feel free to add you name in the contributor list.

Please respect the structuration of the file by adding the following information before your function definition
```r
